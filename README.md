> "rsync is an open source utility that provides fast incremental file transfer. rsync is freely available under the GNU General Public License and is currently being maintained by Wayne Davison."

## Description

The image includes the rsync daemon and configures a separate data directory. The rsync daemon can be used to backup the data of volumes in the Kubernetes cluster.

## Environment Parameters

| Variable | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `RSYNC_AUTHORIZED_KEY` | | Ssh public key that will be added to the authorized keys. |
| `RSYNC_SSH_PORT` | 2222 | Ssh port. |
| `RSYNC_STRICT_HOST_KEY_CHECKING_NO` | false | Set to true to disable strict host checking for connections. |
| `TRUST_HOSTS` | | Hosts that will be added to the known hosts. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Path of the data directory. |

## Exposed Ports

| Port | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
| `2222`  | ssh |

## Directories

| Path | Description |
| ------------- | ----- |
| `/data` | Reserved data directory. |

## Input Configration

| Source | Destination | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `/keys-in/*pub` |  | Keys are added to the authorized keys. |
| `/ssh-in/ssh_host_*` | /etc/ssh/ |  |
| `/ssh-in/sshd_config` | /etc/ssh/ | OpenSSH server configuration. |

## Usage

### Basic

OpenSSH server will be started and accepts connections on port `2222`. The user can connect to the server using the specified keys and use rsync to backup or restore files.

If deployed on Kubernetes, the service can be exposed via NodePort.

```
kubectl expose deploy rsync --type=NodePort --name=rsync-public
rsync -r -v rsync@node:/data/\* /tmp/
```

### Use Tunnel

If the NodePort is blocked or if used behind a firewall a tunnel can be created to the node. For that the most confortable method is to create a `config` file for a fake host `rsync-host`. The fake host must be added to the `hosts` file.

* `/etc/hosts`

```
127.1.1.1 rsync-host
```

* `~/.ssh/config`

```
Host rsync-host
Hostname 127.1.1.1
Port 31233
User rsync
IdentityFile rsyncssh_id_rsa
ProxyCommand ssh user@node nc %h %p
```

## Test

The docker-compose file `test.yaml` can be used to startup the ssh daemon container. The ssh daemon will be available at `localhost:2222`.

```
docker-compose -f test.yaml up
```

Alternatifly, the `make` utility can be used to start a test container.

```
make up
```

To test the rsync daemon container.

```
rsync -rv rsync@localhost:2222/data/. .
```
